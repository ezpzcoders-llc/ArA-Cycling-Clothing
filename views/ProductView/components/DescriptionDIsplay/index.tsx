                        Using a fabric made with recycled yarns and a pattern
                        inspired by the ceramic heritage of the Riviera, Nina is
                        for high summer rides and celebrations. A limited
                        edition design commemorating Bastille Day and the south
                        of France, Nina has mesh panels for extra breathability,
                        and ensures vapour moves quickly away from the body.

                        With modern performance and aerodynamic tailoring, the
                        jersey is constructed for maximum comfort on the bike.
                        The jersey features a reinforced three-pocket section on
                        the rear panel and has a zipped valuable pocket. Nina
                        has a classic fit and is cut slightly longer than normal
                        to provide additional protection.

                        The 14th of July in France is always a glorious day in
                        the calendar for road riders and fans of cycle racing.
                        The greatest race in the world is usually heating up in
                        or near the mountain stages, and it represents the apex
                        of summer riding for many in Europe. Fireworks,
                        festivities and thrills on two wheels. Vive la France.
